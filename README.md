🧑‍💻 I have been providing education in software development and computer hardware for the past 4 years while also working on my own projects. 

👀 Although my formal work experience is limited, I have participated in competitions with artificial intelligence robots and projects focused on innovation in healthcare and commerce. 

📲 I have been working as a .NET backend developer for nearly 2 years and in July 2022, I founded my own venture called Meetsy. My goal in this company is to develop a mobile application.
