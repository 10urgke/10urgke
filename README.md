🧑‍💻 I have been providing education in software development and computer hardware for the past 5 years while also working on my own projects. 


👀 Although my formal work experience is limited, I have participated in competitions with artificial intelligence robots and projects focused on innovation in healthcare and commerce. 


📲 I have been working as a .NET backend developer for nearly 2 years and in July 2022, I founded my own venture called Meetsy. My goal in this company is to develop a mobile application.

🎮 Additionally, I'm currently engaged in game development, exploring the exciting realm of creating interactive and immersive experiences. This passion adds a dynamic element to my profile, allowing me to blend my expertise in software development and computer hardware with the creativity and innovation required in the gaming industry.
